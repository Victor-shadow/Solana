# To maximize stake distribution, decentralization and censorship resistance on the Solana network staking can be performed programmatically

# Solana Foundation Delegation Program
# The Solana Foundation Delegation Program is designed to serve the needs of the network by targeting the following goals:
# 1: Maximize decentralization, reliability and performance of Solana
# 2: Maximize the number of validators who have diverse sources of stake
# 3: Sustain a large and representative testnet

# Stake Pools
# This on-chain program pools together SOL to be staked by a manager, allowing SOL holders to stake and earn rewards without managing stakes. Users deposit SOL in exchange of SPL tokens(staking derivates) that represent their ownership in the stake pool. The pool manager stakes deposited SOL according to their strategy, perharps using a variant of an auto-delegation bot
# As stakes earn rewards, the pool and pool tokens grow proportionally in value. Finally, pool token holders can send SPL tokens back to the stake pools to redeem SOL, thereby participating in decentralization with much less work required
