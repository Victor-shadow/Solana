# SOLANA CLUSTERS

# The Solana blockchain has several different groups of validators, known as Clusters Each serving different purposes within the overall ecosystem and containing dedicated API  nodes to fulfill JSON-RPC requests for their respective clusters
# The individual nodes within a cluster are owned and operated by third parties, with a public endpoint available for each

# SOLANA PUBLIC RPC ENDPOINTS

# The Solana Labs organization operates a public RPC endpoint for each Cluster. Each of these public endpoints are subject to rate limits, but are available for users and developers to interact with the Solana Blockchain

# "Public endpoints rate limits are subject to change."

# USING EXPLORERS WITH DIFFERENT CLUSTERS

# Many of the popular Solana Blockchain explorers support selecting any of the Clusters, often allowing advanced users to add a custom/private PRC endpoint as well
# Solana Blockchain explorers include:
# 1:  http://explorer.solana.com/.

# 2: http://solana.fm/.

# 3: http://solscan.io/.

# 4: http://solanabeach.io/.

# 5: http://validators.app/.

# ON A HIGH LEVEL
#  Mainnet: Live production environment for deployed applications

# Devnet: Testing with public accessibility for developers experimenting  with their applications

# Testnet: Stress-testing for network upgrades and validator performance

# DEVNET
# Devnet serves as a playground for anyone who wants to use Solana as a test drive, as a user, token holder app developeror validator

# Application developers should target Devnet
# Potential validators should first target Devnet
# Key Differences between Devnet and Mainnet Beta:
# 1: Devnet tokens are not real
# 2: Devnet includes a token faucet for airdrops and application testing
# 3: Devnet may be subject to ledger resets
# 4: Devnet typically runs the same software release branch version as Mainnet Beta, but may run a newer minor release version than Mainnet Beta

# Entrypoint for Devnet: entrypoint.devnet.solana.com:8001,

# Devnet Endpoints
# https://api.devnet.solana.com - Single Solana Labs hosted API node, rate-limited
# To connect to the devnet Cluster using the Solana CLI:

# solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

# Devnet Rate Limits
# Maximum number of requests per 10 seconds per IP: 100,
# Maximum number of requets per 10 seconds per IP For a single RPC: 40,
# Maximum concurrent connections per IP: 40,
# Maximum connection rate per 10 seconds per IP: 40,
# Maximum amount of data per 30 seconds: 100MB

# test net
# Testnet is where the Solana core contributors stress test recent release features on a live cluster, particularly focused on network performance, stability and validator behaviour

# Testnet tokens are not real
# Testnet may be subject to ledger resets
# Testnet includes a token faucet for airdrops for application testing
# Testnet typically runs a newer software release  branch than both Devnet and Mainnet Beta
# Entry point for Testnet: entrypoint.testnet.solana.com:8001

# TESTNET ENDPOINT

# COMMON HTTP ERROR CODES
# 403 -- Your IPAddress or website has been blocked. It is time to run your own RPC server(s) or find a private service
# 429 -- Your IPAddress is exceeding the rate limits. Slow down! Use the Retry-After HTTP response header to determine how long to wait before making another request.
